# FhNotifications
FhNotifications is a third-party open-source program for receiving notifications from https://freelancehunt.com.

Since the website cannot send a notification about a new project if the tab with it is closed, I decided to create a convenient Windows application that does this. You just need to run the program, enter your API token (which can be obtained [here](https://freelancehunt.com/my/api)) and, if it is necessary, set the program to autoload. This way you won't miss any notifications and you'll have a better chance of being selected as a performer!
